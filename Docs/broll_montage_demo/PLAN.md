# Project Plan — B-roll Montage Demo

## Goal
Demonstrate rapid assembly editing and transitions using short, visually distinct clips.

## Inputs
- Short B-roll clips from `assets/` (see project `assets/` folder).

## Deliverables (outputs)
- 10–20s montage export with 6–10 cuts.

## Demo Script (MVP)
1. Create a 12–15s timeline.
2. Add 4 clips back-to-back (2–4s each).
3. Add simple crossfades between each.
4. Add a still (nebula or jupiter) as a 1s “breather” mid-montage.
5. Export.

## Constraints
- Keep it short to render quickly during demos.
- Prefer assets that decode reliably and are small enough for repeat runs.

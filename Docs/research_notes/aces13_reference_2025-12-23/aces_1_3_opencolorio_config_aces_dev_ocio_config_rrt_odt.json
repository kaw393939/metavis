  "answer": "Are you looking for the ACES 1.3 OCIO config and how RRT/ODT are represented in it? Here are the essentials:\n\nWhere to get ACES 1.3 OCIO configs\n- Prebuilt configs: Download the ACES 1.3 cg-config and studio-config from the OpenColorIO-Config-ACES releases. The “2.1.0–2.2.0 for ACES 1.3” release ships cg-config-v2.2.0_aces-v1.3_ocio-v2.4.ocio and studio-config-v2.2.0_aces-v1.3_ocio-v2.4.ocio (also bundled with OCIO v2.4.0). Earlier stable and RC tags for ACES 1.3 are also there. ([github.com](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenColorIO-Config-ACES/releases))\n- Repo home (generator + docs): AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenColorIO-Config-ACES. ([github.com](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenColorIO-Config-ACES))\n\nGenerate from aces-dev CTL (if you need to build your own)\n- Clone with submodules, then use the provided invoke tasks:\n  - invoke build-config-cg\n  - invoke build-config-studio\nThese generators discover aces-dev CTL, build the transform graph, and emit OCIO v2 configs. Docker-based builds are also supported. ([github.com](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenColorIO-Config-ACES))\n\nWhere RRT/ODT live in the config\n- In ACES 1.x, the RRT + ODT are combined and exposed as an “Output Transform.” In OCIO v2 configs this is presented as ViewTransforms under Displays (i.e., you pick a Display and a View such as “ACES 1.0 – SDR Video”). ([docs.acescentral.com](https://docs.acescentral.com/system-components/output-transforms/?utm_source=openai))\n- Many DCCs reflect this: using “Display” mode applies RRT+ODT; “Convert” mode is a pure colorimetric conversion to the display space. ([community.acescentral.com](https://community.acescentral.com/t/aces-1-3-now-available/3739/18?utm_source=openai))\n\nACES 1.3 additions you’ll see in the config\n- Reference Gamut Compression (RGC): Included as a Look (“ACES 1.3 Reference Gamut Compression”) with its ACEStransformID; apply it in ACES2065‑1 before the Output Transform when needed. ([github.com](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenColorIO-Config-ACES/releases))\n- RGC background/specs if you need to validate or document: ACES docs pages (specification and implementation guidance). ([docs.acescentral.com](https://docs.acescentral.com/rgc/specification/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIf you tell me your DCC (Nuke, Maya/Arnold, Houdini, Unreal, etc.) and whether you prefer the lean CG config or the broader Studio config, I can give step-by-step setup and the exact Display/View choices that map to the RRT+ODT you want.",

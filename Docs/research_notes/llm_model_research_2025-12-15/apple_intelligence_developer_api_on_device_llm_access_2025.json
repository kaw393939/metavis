  "query": "Apple Intelligence developer API on-device LLM access 2025",
  "answer": "Short answer: yes. In 2025 Apple opened direct, on‑device LLM access to developers via the Foundation Models framework.\n\nWhat you get\n- Direct calls to the Apple Intelligence on‑device foundation model (about 3B parameters), optimized for privacy, low latency, and offline use. Built‑ins include guided generation and tool calling; it’s Swift‑native and can be wired up in “a few lines of code.” ([apple.com](https://www.apple.com/cm/newsroom/2025/06/apple-intelligence-gets-even-more-powerful-with-new-capabilities-across-apple-devices/?utm_source=openai))\n- No per‑call inference fees for on‑device use. ([apple.com](https://www.apple.com/sn/newsroom/2025/06/apple-supercharges-its-tools-and-technologies-for-developers/?utm_source=openai))\n- Optional fine‑tuning via the Foundation Models Adapter Training Toolkit; shipping adapters requires a special entitlement (not needed to use the base model). ([developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/jp/apple-intelligence/foundation-models-adapter/?utm_source=openai))\n\nAvailability and requirements\n- Ships with iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 on Apple Intelligence–compatible devices (e.g., iPhone 15 Pro/16 family; M‑series Macs/iPads) when Apple Intelligence is enabled. ([apple.com](https://www.apple.com/in/newsroom/2025/09/apples-foundation-models-framework-unlocks-new-intelligent-app-experiences/?utm_source=openai))\n\nImportant limitation\n- As of December 16, 2025, Apple’s public APIs expose the on‑device model; Apple has not announced a general developer API to its larger Private Cloud Compute models. Reporting around WWDC25 also characterized developer access as on‑device only. ([developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/apple-intelligence/whats-new/?utm_source=openai))\n\nWant a quick-start? I can outline the minimal setup, common patterns (summarize, extract, structure with guided generation, tool calling), and how to package and ship an adapter.",

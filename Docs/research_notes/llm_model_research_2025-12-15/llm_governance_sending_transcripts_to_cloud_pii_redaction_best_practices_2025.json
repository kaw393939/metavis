  "answer": "Here’s a 2025-ready, vendor-neutral playbook for safely sending transcripts (chat, call, meeting, support) to cloud LLMs while protecting PII and meeting governance and compliance expectations.\n\n1) Set your policy and scope first\n- Define allowed use cases and lawful basis; record these in a DPIA/PIA for any workflow involving personal data. Align with NIST AI RMF “Govern/Map/Measure/Manage” functions and the NIST Privacy Framework. ([nist.gov](https://www.nist.gov/publications/artificial-intelligence-risk-management-framework-ai-rmf-10?utm_source=openai))\n- Apply data minimization and purpose limitation: only send what the LLM needs. These are core GDPR principles even if you operate outside the EU. ([eur-lex.europa.eu](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX%3A62023CJ0065&utm_source=openai))\n\n2) Choose the right protection model per use case\n- Irreversible redaction: remove PII before the cloud call where you do not need to map results back to the person.\n- Reversible pseudonymization: replace PII with stable tokens and keep the mapping in a separate, access-controlled vault for post-processing or analytics. Follow ISO/IEC 27559 (de-identification framework), ISO/IEC 20889 (techniques), and the GDPR definition of pseudonymization. ([iso.org](https://www.iso.org/standard/71677.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n3) Build a multi-engine PII detection pipeline (do this before the cloud)\n- Combine: high-precision patterns (regex + checksums for PAN/SSN), ML NER, and domain-specific recognizers. Open-source + managed options exist (e.g., Microsoft Presidio; cloud DLP services for tokenization/FPE, hashing, masking). ([github.com](https://github.com/microsoft/presidio?utm_source=openai))\n- For audio/video, perform ASR and diarization in a trusted environment; OCR PDFs/images; then run the same redaction stack on the transcript and extracted text before sending upstream.\n\n4) Standardize what to redact\n- Direct identifiers: names, emails, phone numbers, full addresses, government IDs, account/PANs, IBAN/SWIFT, device IDs, IPs.\n- Quasi-identifiers: birthdates, small geographies, rare job roles, unique timestamps.\n- Sensitive attributes: health, biometrics, union, religion, precise location, children’s data.\n- Use allow-lists for non-PII entities you must keep (product names, ticket IDs) and deny-lists for high-risk patterns. Catalog entity types and operators using ISO/IEC 20889 terminology. ([iso.org](https://www.iso.org/standard/69373.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n5) Pick redaction operators that balance utility and risk\n- Options: delete, mask, generalize/bucket (e.g., month/year only), tokenize (format-preserving if you must preserve structure), salted hashing (one-way), or encryption (with customer-managed keys) for reversible flows. Google’s Sensitive Data Protection (Cloud DLP) documentation illustrates common choices. ([cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/taking-charge-of-your-data-using-cloud-dlp-to-de-identify-and-obfuscate-sensitive-information?utm_source=openai))\n\n6) Keep payment data out of the LLM boundary\n- Never transmit full PAN, track, or SAD to cloud LLMs. If transcripts may contain card data, truncate to last-4 or tokenize inside the CDE first. Note that PCI DSS v4.0 future-dated requirements became mandatory on March 31, 2025. ([bdo.com](https://www.bdo.com/insights/digital/pci-dss-version-4-0-implementation-timeline?utm_source=openai))\n\n7) Align with sector and health rules when relevant\n- For PHI, either meet HIPAA de-identification Safe Harbor (remove 18 identifiers) or use Expert Determination before cloud processing. HHS OCR guidance remains the reference. ([hhs.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/index.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n8) Contract, locations, and logging\n- Treat the cloud LLM provider as a processor: execute a DPA, assess sub-processors, specify retention, deletion, and data residency. Favor ISO/IEC 27018–certified controls for cloud PII processors. ([iso.org](https://www.iso.org/cms/%20render/live/en/sites/isoorg/contents/data/standard/08/81/88150.html?utm_source=openai))\n- Keep raw transcripts in your tenant; send only minimized/redacted text; enforce private networking and customer-managed keys.\n- Turn off provider logging where possible; document any residual logging and retention.\n\n9) EU/UK implications you may face even from the US\n- If you process EU/UK data, keep an eye on phased EU AI Act obligations through 2025–2027 and ensure transparency and governance are in place for GPAI uses by August 2, 2025. For GDPR, pseudonymized data is still personal data if you can re-link; treat it accordingly. ([ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/eu-ai-act-implementation-timeline?utm_source=openai))\n\n10) Prompting and output controls\n- Use system prompts to forbid soliciting or echoing PII; provide safe completion patterns. Add a post-output PII scan to catch any leaked identifiers before storing or displaying. Maintain an “allowed PII” exception list only where legally necessary (e.g., authenticated 1:1 service interactions).\n\n11) Quality, testing, and monitoring\n- Establish test sets with multilingual, noisy, and adversarial patterns (OCR errors, ASR mistakes). Measure precision/recall/F1 for each entity class; set a false-negative ceiling by risk tier (e.g., 0% for PAN/SSN). Managed services publish entity coverage and metrics—verify on your data. ([docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ai/responsible-ai/comprehend-detectpii/overview.html?utm_source=openai))\n- Periodically re-evaluate re-identification risk and attack surfaces (linkage, singling-out, inference) per ISO/IEC 27559 and ICO anonymization guidance. Include a motivated-intruder review and human-in-the-loop for low-confidence detections. ([iso.org](https://www.iso.org/standard/71677.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n12) Operations and accountability\n- Maintain data lineage: what was removed, by which detector, with what confidence, and which operator was applied.\n- Incident playbooks must cover accidental PII egress to vendors, with notification duties per jurisdiction.\n- Document end-to-end governance using NIST AI RMF/GenAI Profile and your privacy framework mappings for audits. ([nist.gov](https://www.nist.gov/publications/artificial-intelligence-risk-management-framework-ai-rmf-10?utm_source=openai))\n\nReference architecture (summary)\n- Stage 0: Ingest to a secure enclave; classify data and run ASR/OCR as needed.\n- Stage 1: PII detection (rules + ML + dictionaries); uncertainty thresholds; human review for low-confidence.\n- Stage 2: Redaction/pseudonymization (hash/FPE/tokenize/blank) with CMK/HSM; store reversible mappings in a separate vault.\n- Stage 3: Prompt hardening + allow-list filtering; send minimized payload to the cloud LLM over private link; disable logging/retention.\n- Stage 4: Post-output scan; de-tokenize only where authorized; write outputs and lineage to secure storage; enforce retention limits.\n- Stage 5: Continuous evaluation, drift checks, and periodic re-identification risk assessments against standards. ([github.com](https://github.com/microsoft/presidio?utm_source=openai))\n\nQuick checklists you can adopt today\n- Governance: DPIA/PIA on file; DPA executed; retention ≤ business need; roles and access scoped; data residency documented. ([nist.gov](https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework?utm_source=openai))\n- Technical: Local redaction before cloud; zero raw PAN/SSN egress; CMK; private networking; redaction metrics monitored; output PII filter in place. ([bdo.com](https://www.bdo.com/insights/digital/pci-dss-version-4-0-implementation-timeline?utm_source=openai))\n- Standards alignment: ISO/IEC 27559 + 20889 for techniques; ISO/IEC 27018 (cloud PII); NIST AI RMF + Privacy Framework; HIPAA de-ID where PHI; track EU AI Act phases if you touch EU data. ([iso.org](https://www.iso.org/standard/71677.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nWould a succinct template policy, a redaction taxonomy for your transcript types, or sample evaluator metrics help? If you share your main jurisdictions and transcript sources (chat, voice, tickets), I can tailor those next.",

# Sprint 12 Audit: Creator Workflow Backlog

## Status: In Progress (Foundations + Partial Wiring)

## Accomplishments
- **Vision**: Defined "Clean Water" north star.
- **Strategy**: Local-first, ACEScg, iPhone-to-Mac.
- **Backlog**: Themes for future execution.
- **Foundations now present**: FITS ingest + simulation decode, `MetaVisLab fits-timeline` export path, caption sidecar writers, and VFR probe + normalization decision layer.

## Gaps & Missing Features
- **Implementation**: Several foundations exist, but the broader creator-workflow backlog (ACEScg enforcement, VFR resampling + sync, scientific raster compositing, dialog/captions automation, iPhone transfer) remains incomplete.

## Technical Debt
- N/A (Backlog sprint)

## Recommendations
- Proceed with Sprint 13+ to implement.

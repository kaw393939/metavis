# Awaiting Implementation

## Gaps & Missing Features
- None blocking Sprint 16 v1.

## Follow-on (v2+) Enhancements
- Broaden orchestration coverage to additional features/commands (beyond auto color + auto speaker audio).
- Add more explicit progress reporting hooks for long QA-on runs.

## Recommendations
- Keep QA-on runs gated and audit-friendly.

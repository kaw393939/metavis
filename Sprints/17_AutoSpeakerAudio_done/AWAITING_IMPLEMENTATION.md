# Awaiting Implementation

## Gaps & Missing Features
- **Granular Control**: All-or-nothing preset application.
- **Telemetry**: `audioFrames` data ignored.
- **Loudness**: No LUFS targeting.

## Notes
- These are v2+ enhancements; Sprint 17 v1 is proposal-only and bounded/deterministic.

## Recommendations
- Use `audioFrames` for EQ decisions.
- Implement LUFS targeting.

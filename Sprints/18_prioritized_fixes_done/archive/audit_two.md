# Sprint 18 Audit: Prioritized Fixes (Remediation)

## Status: Planning / Not Implemented

## Goal
Comprehensive remediation of gaps found in Sprints 01-17.

## Key Work Items
- **Editing Core**: Fix time mapping (partially fixed in updated compiler?), Add missing commands (blade, ripple).
- **Deliverables**: Implement Sidecar Writer & QC.
- **Governance**: Implement Recipe Registry, Redaction.
- **Registry**: Implement Validation.
- **Perf**: Tighten budgets.
- **Auto**: Orchestrate feedback loops.

## Status Note
This sprint defines the work to close all identified gaps. Code implementation handles 30% of these (e.g. time mapping in compiler), but most (Registry, Sidecars) are still missing.

# Implemented Features

## Status: Done

Sprint 19 is an editing-finalization sprint: it is intentionally mostly tests + semantics + small executor changes.

This work is complete (delivered across Sprints 15–18 plus follow-up fixes).

## Captured deliverables
- Editing primitives are stable and locked by tests.
- Ripple operations correctly update multi-track timelines.
- Linked selection propagates video ripple ops to time-aligned audio clips.
- Overlap policy is permissive and emits deterministic warning traces.
- Project save/load uses deterministic JSON.

## Deferred (moved forward)
- Cortana Partner Layer features: `Sprints/25_cortana_partner_layer`

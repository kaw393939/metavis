# Sprint 19 — Editing Finalization (Vibe Editing Core) — DONE

## Goal
Finish the editing core so higher-level workflows can assume editing semantics are stable.

## Status
Done.

This sprint folder is intentionally kept as a “contract snapshot” of the editing-finalization intent.
The originally drafted Partner Layer / Cortana foundation work was moved forward into Sprint 25:
- `Sprints/25_cortana_partner_layer`

## Deliverables (captured by tests + implementation)
- Deterministic targeting + typed commands
- Multi-track ripple behavior + linked-selection propagation (video ↔ time-aligned audio)
- Deterministic overlap warning traces (permissive overlap policy)
- Project persistence (full project document save/load)
- Deterministic face identity hashing placeholder suitable for later Cast List / memory wiring

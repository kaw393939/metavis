# Sprint 23 — Complete

Sprint 23 is implemented.

See `IMPLEMENTED.md` for the current contract, scripts, and tests.

## Follow-ons (out of Sprint 23 scope)
- Determinism hardening (pin versions + capture tool/model metadata in summary).
- Export-pipeline end-to-end chaining test (generate adjacent captions, then run deliverable export and assert transcript sidecars).
- Transition to Sprint 24: speaker diarization post-process that fills `speakerId/speakerLabel`.

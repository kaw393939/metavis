# MetaVisIngest

**MetaVisIngest** is the "airlock" for the MetaVis system. It is responsible for validating, analyzing, and normalizing external media before it is allowed onto the Timeline.

## Modules

### 1. Scientific Imaging (FITS)
A native Swift reader for the FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) format. This allows MetaVis to ingest raw astronomical data for high-fidelity, high-dynamic-range backgrounds without converting to intermediate formats like EXR first.

### 2. Video Timing Guard
Automated analysis of video file timing to detect Variable Frame Rate (VFR) media, which is a common source of audio drift in editing applications.

### 3. Generative Ingest (LIGM)
Infrastructure for ingesting assets generated by local AI models (Stable Diffusion, etc.) directly into the asset system.

## Usage

```swift
import MetaVisIngest

// Check if a file is VFR
let stats = try await VideoTimingProbe.probe(url: myFile)
if stats.isVFRLikely {
    // triggering conform workflow...
}
```

## Dependencies
- `MetaVisCore`
- `AVFoundation`

# Implemented Features

## Status: Planning / Not Implemented

This sprint captures the remaining “Partner Layer” features that were originally drafted in Sprint 19.

When implementation begins, update this file with:
- the final Cast List schema and persistence strategy
- the identity wiring approach (`personId` stability rules)
- the Agent API surface and tests added
- the end-to-end workflow coverage

# Sprint 25: Cortana Partner Layer

This sprint captures the “good features” from the original Sprint 19 draft that are not yet implemented:
- project memory for people (`personId` → name)
- identity wiring so the system can refer to people consistently
- a minimal Agent API layer that composes deterministic primitives
